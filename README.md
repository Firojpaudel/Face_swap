# ðŸŽ­ Face Swap Fun with OpenCV ðŸŽ­

### Project Overview
Ever wondered what you'd look like with someone elseâ€™s face? Well, hereâ€™s your chance to find outâ€”without any dark magic involved, just pure Python wizardry! This project uses OpenCV to swap faces between two images, giving you a glimpse into the wild world of AI-driven image manipulation. Whether youâ€™re looking for a laugh or diving into the technical side of image processing, this project has got you covered!

### Requirements
Before diving into the face-swapping frenzy, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

* opencv-python
* CMake
* numpy
* dlib
* requests
* pillow

To make life easier, Iâ€™ve included a `requirements.txt` file. Just run the command below to install all dependencies at once:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Firojpaudel/Face_swap.git
```
#### 2. Update Image URLs
Currently, the URLs for image1 and image2 (the before images) need to be updated manually in the script. Replace the placeholder URLs with your own image URLs before running the script.

#### 3. Run the Script
Once everything is set up, run the blocks to see the magic happen.

#### 4. Future Plans
I'm planning to make this even cooler by adding a Flask app for a more polished UI/UX experience. Stay tuned ðŸ˜‰!

#### Example Output:
Checkout [`result.jpg`](./result.jpg) to see the output.
